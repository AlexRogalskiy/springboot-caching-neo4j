= `springboot-neo4j-caffeine`

The goal of this project is to implement a simple application that handles restaurants and explore how caching works.
The application has some endpoints to manage restaurants, cities (where the restaurants are located in) and dishes
the restaurants have. We are using https://github.com/ben-manes/caffeine[Caffeine] for caching and https://neo4j.com[Neo4j]
for storage.

== Caching

The application uses 3 caches: `CITIES`, `RESTAURANTS` and `DISHES`.

The caching is applied at controller level. For instance, if you call `GET /api/restaurants/123` for the first time,
the application will check whether the key `123` is present in the `RESTAURANTS` cache; if not, it must go to DB
in order to get the information about the restaurant (payload). Let's say that the payload is
```
{
    "name": "Happy Pizza", "city": {"id": 1, "name": "Berlin"}, "dishes": []
}
```

Before the endpoint finishes and returns the result, the key and its payload are saved in `RESTAURANTS` cache:
```
{
    "123" = {"name": "Happy Pizza", "city": {"id": 1, "name": "Berlin"}, "dishes": []}
}
```

On subsequents calls to `GET /api/restaurants/123` (and as far as the data is not evicted), the application just needs
to go to the cache and get the value.

By the way, we have implemented more advanced caching logic as the one presented above. For example, imagine that you
have a city cached in `CITIES` cache and a new restaurant is created in that city. In this case, the cache of the city
is evicted of `CITIES` (because the list of restaurants in the city changed) and a new cache for the restaurant is put in
RESTAURANTS cache. The same happens when a restaurant is deleted/update or a restaurant dish is added/deleted/updated.

== Start Environment

- Open one terminal

- In `springboot-neo4j-caffeine` root folder run
----
docker-compose up -d
----

[NOTE]
====
To stop and remove containers, networks and volumes
```
docker-compose down -v
```
====

- Wait a little bit to docker containers be up and healthy. To check it, run
----
docker-compose ps
----

== Start application using Maven

In `springboot-neo4j-caffeine` root folder run
----
./mvnw spring-boot:run
----

== Using application

In order to interact with the application, you can access `Swagger` website: http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html

== Neo4j

You can access the UI of Neo4j running in the docker container at http://localhost:7474/browser

== TODO

- Add AOP to log whenever the endpoint is called;
- Create a bash script that uses Neo4j API to insert some data.
