= springboot-neo4j-caffeine

The goal of this project is to explore how caching works. For it, we are going to implement a simple https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/[`Spring Boot`] application called `restaurant-api`. We are using https://neo4j.com[`Neo4j`] for storage and, for caching, we can pick one of the following providers: https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/spring-boot-features.html#boot-features-caching-provider-simple[`Simple`], https://github.com/ben-manes/caffeine[`Caffeine`] or https://redis.io/[`Redis`].

== Applications

* **restaurant-api**
+
`Spring Boot` Web Java application that has endpoints to manage restaurants, cities (where the restaurants are located in) and dishes that restaurants have. Data is stored in `Neo4j` and caching handled by `Caffeine` or `Redis`.

== Caching

The application uses 3 caches: `CITIES`, `RESTAURANTS` and `DISHES`.

The caching is applied at controller level. For instance, if you call `GET /api/restaurants/123` for the first time, the application will check whether the key `123` is present in the `RESTAURANTS` cache; if not, it must go to DB to get the information about the restaurant (payload). Let's say that the payload is

[source]
----
{
    "name": "Happy Pizza", "city": {"id": 1, "name": "Berlin"}, "dishes": []
}
----

Before the endpoint finishes and returns the result, the key and its payload are saved in `RESTAURANTS` cache

[source]
----
{
    "123" = {"name": "Happy Pizza", "city": {"id": 1, "name": "Berlin"}, "dishes": []}
}
----

On subsequents calls to `GET /api/restaurants/123` (and as far as the data is not evicted), the application just needs to go to the cache and get the value.

By the way, we have implemented more advanced caching logic as the one presented above. For example, imagine that you have a city cached in `CITIES` cache and a new restaurant is created in that city. In this case, the cache of the city is evicted of `CITIES` (because the list of restaurants in the city changed) and a new cache for the restaurant is put in `RESTAURANTS` cache. The same happens when a restaurant is deleted/update or a restaurant dish is added/deleted/updated.

== Prerequisites

* https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html[`Java 11+`]
* https://www.docker.com/[`Docker`]
* https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/[`Docker-Compose`]
* https://stedolan.github.io/jq[`jq`]

== Start Environment

* Open a terminal and, inside `springboot-neo4j-caffeine` root folder, run
+
[source]
----
docker-compose up -d
----

* Wait until docker containers be up and healthy. To check it, run
+
[source]
----
docker-compose ps
----

== Start application using Maven

* In a terminal, make sure you are inside `springboot-neo4j-caffeine` root folder

* Run one of the following command
+
|===
|Profile |Cache Provider |Command

|default
|Simple
|./mvnw clean spring-boot:run --projects restaurant-api

|caffeine
|Caffeine
|./mvnw clean spring-boot:run --projects restaurant-api -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=caffeine

|redis
|Redis
|./mvnw clean spring-boot:run --projects restaurant-api -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=redis
|===

* In order to interact with the application, you can access `Swagger` at http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html

== Simulation

* Create a city
+
[source]
----
CITY_ID=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/cities -H  "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name":"Berlin"}' | jq -r .id)

curl -i http://localhost:8080/api/cities/$CITY_ID
----

* Create a restaurant in the city
+
[source]
----
RESTAURANT_ID=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/restaurants -H  "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"cityId":"'$CITY_ID'", "name":"Happy Burger"}' | jq -r .id)

curl -i http://localhost:8080/api/restaurants/$RESTAURANT_ID
----

* Create a dish for the restaurant
+
[source]
----
DISH_ID=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/restaurants/$RESTAURANT_ID/dishes -H  "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name":"Cheese Burger", "price":9.99}' | jq -r .id)

curl -i http://localhost:8080/api/restaurants/$RESTAURANT_ID/dishes/$DISH_ID
----

== Useful Links

* **Neo4j**
+
`Neo4j` UI can be accessed at http://localhost:7474/browser
+

== Shutdown

* To stop `restaurant-api`, go to the terminal where it's running and press `Ctrl+C`

* To stop and remove docker-compose containers, networks and volumes, in a terminal and inside `springboot-neo4j-caffeine` root folder, run the following command
+
[source]
----
docker-compose down -v
----

== Running Unit And Integration Test Cases

* In a terminal, make sure you are inside `springboot-neo4j-caffeine` root folder

* Execute one of the commands below
+
|===
|Profile |Cache Provider |Command

|default
|Simple
|./mvnw clean verify

|caffeine
|Caffeine
|./mvnw clean verify -DargLine="-Dspring.profiles.active=caffeine"

|redis
|Redis
|./mvnw clean verify -DargLine="-Dspring.profiles.active=redis"
|===

== TODO

* Add cache statistics in a Grafana Dashboard;
* Add AOP to log whenever the endpoint is called;
* Create a bash script that uses Neo4j API to insert some data.
