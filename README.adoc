= springboot-neo4j-caffeine

The goal of this project is to implement a simple https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/[`Spring Boot`] Web Java application that handles restaurants and explore how caching works. The application has some endpoints to manage  restaurants, cities (where the restaurants are located in) and dishes the restaurants have. We are using https://github.com/ben-manes/caffeine[`Caffeine`] for caching and https://neo4j.com[`Neo4j`] for storage.

== Caching

The application uses 3 caches: `CITIES`, `RESTAURANTS` and `DISHES`.

The caching is applied at controller level. For instance, if you call `GET /api/restaurants/123` for the first time, the application will check whether the key `123` is present in the `RESTAURANTS` cache; if not, it must go to DB to get the information about the restaurant (payload). Let's say that the payload is

[source]
----
{
    "name": "Happy Pizza", "city": {"id": 1, "name": "Berlin"}, "dishes": []
}
----

Before the endpoint finishes and returns the result, the key and its payload are saved in `RESTAURANTS` cache

[source]
----
{
    "123" = {"name": "Happy Pizza", "city": {"id": 1, "name": "Berlin"}, "dishes": []}
}
----

On subsequents calls to `GET /api/restaurants/123` (and as far as the data is not evicted), the application just needs to go to the cache and get the value.

By the way, we have implemented more advanced caching logic as the one presented above. For example, imagine that you have a city cached in `CITIES` cache and a new restaurant is created in that city. In this case, the cache of the city is evicted of `CITIES` (because the list of restaurants in the city changed) and a new cache for the restaurant is put in `RESTAURANTS` cache. The same happens when a restaurant is deleted/update or a restaurant dish is added/deleted/updated.
